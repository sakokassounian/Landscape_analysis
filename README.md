# Landscape_analysis

This scripts takes a landscape image which contains a line in the middle. The line is detected by applying thresholding using Otsu's method. It then seperates the 2 regions which are darker than each other. 

The brightnesses are matched using simple min/max scaling and coadded to get the final result. 

Enjoy!
